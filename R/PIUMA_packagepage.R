#' PIUMA: Phenotypes Identification Using Mapper from topological data Analysis
#'
#' The application of unsupervised learning methodologies could help the
#' identification of specific phenotypes in huge heterogeneous cohorts,
#' such as clinical or -omics data. Among them, the Topological Data Analysis
#'  (TDA) is a rapidly growing field that combines concepts from algebraic
#' topology and computational geometry to analyze and extract meaningful
#' information from complex and high-dimensional data sets. Moreover,
#' TDA is a robust and effective methodology, able to preserve the
#' intrinsic characteristics of data and the mutual relations among
#'  observations, depicting complex data in a graph-based representation.
#'  Indeed, building topological models as networks, TDA allows complex
#'  diseases to be inspected in a continuous space, where subjects can
#'  fluctuate over the graph, sharing, at the same time, more than one
#'  adjacent node of the network. Overall, TDA offers a powerful set
#'  of tools to capture the underlying topological features of data,
#'  revealing essential patterns and relationships that might be
#'  hidden from traditional statistical techniques.
#'  The PIUMA package (Phenotypes Identification Using Mapper from
#'  topological data Analysis) allows implementing all the main
#'  steps of a Topological Data Analysis.
#'  PIUMA is the italian word meaning 'feather'.

#' See the package vignette, by typing \code{vignette("PIUMA")} to discover
#' all the functions.
